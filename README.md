* Study Hours and Performance:** The correlation between study hours and grades suggests that students who balance their study time effectively tend to perform better, supporting the importance of structured learning schedules.


 💡 In-Analysis Recommendation

* Optimize Study-Social Media Balance:** Encourage students to maintain a moderate social media presence (10-19 hours per week) while prioritizing academic commitments.
* Interactive Learning Tools:** Implement engaging online learning platforms to integrate educational content within social media spaces, making academic work more appealing.
* Personalized Learning Strategies:** Encourage students to track their study habits and time spent online to develop personalized strategies for balancing coursework and digital interactions.



 📈 9. Post-Analysis Insights


* Moderate Social Media Usage as a Learning Aid:** Controlled social media engagement appears to complement academic performance, possibly due to online educational content and peer discussions.
* Excessive Usage May Reduce Peak Performance:** While extreme social media engagement does not necessarily result in failure, it may prevent students from attaining the highest grades.
* Engagement in Discussions Matters:** Students actively participating in discussions tend to retain knowledge better, further reinforcing the importance of collaborative learning.
* Time Management as a Success Factor:** The most successful students exhibited structured learning patterns rather than excessive online distractions.



 💬 Post-Analysis Recommendation

* Encourage Academic Social Media Use:** Leverage platforms like LinkedIn Learning, YouTube tutorials, and academic Twitter discussions to promote productive online engagement.
* Set Screen Time Limits:** Introduce self-regulation techniques, like setting specific study times and limiting social media during peak learning hours.
* Incorporate Gamified Learning:** Develop interactive and gamified educational content that keeps students engaged without excessive social media distractions.
* Further Research on Digital Learning Habits:** Conduct more in-depth studies on how specific platforms impact student engagement and academic success, allowing for refined learning strategies.



📊 10. Data Visualizations (Summarized)

* Assignment Completion:** High performers submit more consistently
* Social Media Use:** Peak performance at 10–19 hours/week
* Courses Completed:** 15–20 courses is the sweet spot
* Study Hours:** Most students study 20–39 hours/week
* Grades:** Majority earn Grade A; outliers need support
* Sleep:** 5–8 hours linked to better focus
* Stress:** Medium stress levels most common; high stress hinders learning
* Discussions:** Active participation improves comprehension



 📝 11. Recommendations Summary

* Encourage a Balanced Approach to Social Media Usage:** Students who spent 10-19 hours per week on social media performed the best, with Grade A as the most common outcome. It is recommended that students be guided on productive social media engagement, such as using educational platforms, study groups, and academic content to supplement learning.
* Promote Consistent Course Completion:** The majority of students completed 15-20 courses, which aligns with stronger academic outcomes. Online schools should provide structured learning paths, course completion tracking, and incentives for students who consistently complete courses to sustain engagement.
* Encourage Optimal Study Time Allocation:** Students who studied between 20-39 hours per week performed the best, indicating that regular study habits improve learning outcomes. Schools should introduce study planners, productivity tools, and self-assessment exercises to help students maintain an effective study routine.
* Address Sleep and Stress Management:** The data shows that students getting 5-8 hours of sleep per night tend to perform well, while excessive stress negatively impacts performance. Schools should provide stress management resources, such as mindfulness programs, counseling, and flexible study schedules, to ensure students maintain both mental and physical well-being.
* Increase Participation in Discussions:** A higher number of students actively engaged in discussions, reinforcing its value in knowledge retention. Schools should foster peer-to-peer learning, Q\&A forums, and group projects to further enhance interaction and critical thinking skills.
* Optimize Digital Learning Strategies:** Given that moderate social media use correlates with better performance, educators should integrate gamified learning, interactive content, and AI-driven study tools into the curriculum to keep students engaged while ensuring they remain academically productive.



 🏁 12. Conclusion

This report shows that moderate social media use, consistent study habits, and active engagement are key to academic success. Online learning thrives when students manage time, reduce stress, and use tech tools wisely. Future work should further explore digital habits to fine-tune educational strategies.
